- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Tecnology Information area facing to hardware.<br><br>

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about the PHP and the frameworks around the same.<br><br>

- ğŸ“« I'm 28 years old and always liked tecnology, but only it was after meeting developer area that I was really interested. I like new challenges and I'm very excited when I reach a goal, whether personal or professional.<br><br>

- âš¡ Fun fact: With 23 years old I thought I was too old to change my carrer, however it was my friends and family that changed my mind, thereby I made a lot of friends and got it new opportunities in the tecnology area, making me pursue my goals even more.
